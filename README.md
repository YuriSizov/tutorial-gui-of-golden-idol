## Tutorial: The GUI of the Golden Idol

This is a tutorial project that demonstrates how core mechanics of
the game _[The Case of the Golden Idol](https://www.thegoldenidol.com/)_
can be implemented in Godot 4.

_The Case of the Golden Idol_ is a detective game in which you pick clues
from various texts spread across multiple scenes in various scenarios. You
then use those clues to build a dossier of sorts, by filling in the blanks,
that summarizes your read on the situation and the conclusion, resolving
each scenario.

In this tutorial you will learn how to utilize `RichTextLabel`, `RichTextEffect`,
and the built-in drag'n'drop system in Godot to implement this core mechanic.

Or simply check out this project using `git` and _investigate_ the code yourself!

_This project is compatible with **Godot 4.3**._
